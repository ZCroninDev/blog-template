# Getting Started with Markdown Posts

Markdown makes writing content fast and portable. Just drop a `.md` file into the `content/posts` directory and Nuxt will pick it up.

## Why Markdown?

- Lightweight, readable syntax
- Easy version control with git
- Perfect for developer-focused blogs

## Next Steps

Continue building out your blog by adding more markdown files, or extend the parser to support advanced features like syntax highlighting and frontmatter-based tagging.
